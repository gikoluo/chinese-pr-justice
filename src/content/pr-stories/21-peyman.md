My PR application (Express Entry STEM) was submitted in December 2023. Every other stage — Eligibility, Medical, Criminality — was cleared long ago. My wife and two children remain in Iran, caught in a cycle of painful separation exceeding two years, while I watch my children grow up through a screen. My eldest daughter's Post-Graduation Work Permit has been delayed over 280 days, forcing a top-university Master's graduate into a part-time barista job instead of a specialized career."

timeline: "PR submitted Dec 2023 (Express Entry STEM #274) → Eligibility, Medical, Criminality all cleared → Security screening since Apr 2024 → Wife and two children in Iran, separated 2+ years → Daughter's PGWP delayed 280+ days → MP inquiries met with template responses"

Although this platform focuses on Chinese applicants, the Security Screening delay is a systemic issue affecting many of us. I am sharing my story to show that this is a broader crisis of IRCC/CBSA accountability that affects the integrity of the entire Canadian immigration system.

I am writing to express my profound frustration regarding the indefinite delay of my Permanent Residence application (Express Entry - STEM #274), submitted in December 2023. While every other stage — Eligibility, Medical, and Criminality — was cleared long ago, my life has been placed in a state of administrative paralysis due to a "Security Screening" ongoing since April 2024.

The human cost is immeasurable: my wife and two children remain in Iran, caught in a cycle of painful separation exceeding two years, while I am forced to watch my children grow up through a screen.

This bureaucratic inertia has even trickled down to my eldest daughter's Post-Graduation Work Permit, now delayed over 280 days, jeopardizing her professional future and our family's stability.

Despite inquiries through MP offices, we are met with nothing but cold indifference and templated "in progress" notifications.

The government must realize that keeping immigrants in this indefinite "limbo" yields nothing but a dysfunctional, high-stress, and psychologically fractured society; you are not "screening" for security, you are systematically breeding hopelessness and clinical depression among those who arrived with the highest aspirations for Canada.

Security screening should be a tool for safety, not a mask for administrative incompetence or a humanitarian failure that leaves long-term scars on the social fabric of this country. We demand accountability, transparency, and an immediate final decision.

The irony of this "security screening" is as glaring as it is painful. While Canada struggles with rising crime rates and the strain of fraudulent asylum claims on taxpayer resources, my family — who arrived with impeccable legal standing, full financial independence, and a commitment to contributing to this economy — is held hostage behind an impenetrable wall of bureaucracy. What "security" is being protected when a high-achieving Master's graduate from one of Canada's top universities is forced into a part-time barista job instead of a specialized career, simply because her work permit is trapped in administrative limbo? There is no logic in a system that invalidates the health cards and credit of the very professionals it invited to build its future, while ignoring real threats.

This is not a security measure; it is the systematic sabotage of talent and the deliberate destruction of a family's dignity.
