teaser: "I am a PR applicant under the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) on a closed work permit. I have been working for the same employer for four years with no flexibility. Financial pressure on our family is overwhelming; we hoped that with PR I could take on an additional job. Our two children are in middle and high school—we had planned for them to apply for student loans for university once we had PR, but with security screening dragging on indefinitely we are losing hope. We have lived in Canada four to five years, contributing and paying taxes. It feels unfair and inhumane."

timeline: "MPNP PR applicant → Closed work permit; same employer for 4 years → Security screening ongoing indefinitely → Two children in middle/high school; student loan plans on hold → 4–5 years in Canada, paying taxes → No government or SOE background; husband's second degree from UESTC (Business Admin), private sector work"

I am a permanent residence (PR) applicant under the Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP). I have been on a closed work permit the entire time, meaning I am only allowed to work for one employer. Because of the ongoing security screening, I have now been working for this same employer for four years. The financial pressure on our family is becoming overwhelming. We have been holding on to the hope that once we receive PR, I will have more flexibility in planning my employment — for example, taking on an additional job to help ease our financial burden.

At the same time, we have two children in middle and high school. We had planned that once we receive PR status, they would be eligible to apply for student loans to attend university. However, with the security screening dragging on indefinitely, we are gradually losing hope. We have already lived in Canada for four to five years, contributing our labour and paying taxes. It feels as though Immigration is exploiting and misleading us. The process feels deeply unfair and inhumane.

Neither my husband nor I have ever worked for government departments or state-owned enterprises in our home country. The only possible factor we can think of is that my husband has a second degree certificate from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in Business Administration. However, that was not his primary graduating institution. He later worked in network operations at a bulk commodity exchange, which was a private company. We are not members of the Communist Party, nor have we ever been involved in politics.

We truly cannot think of any other reason that would make our case "sensitive." Yet because of this, our entire family has had to endure such a prolonged and uncertain wait. It feels incredibly unfair.
