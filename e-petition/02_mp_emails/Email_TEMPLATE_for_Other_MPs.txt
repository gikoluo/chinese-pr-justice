SUBJECT: Request to Sponsor E-Petition: Immigration Processing Crisis Affecting [MP's Riding/Community]

Dear [MP Name],

I am writing to request your sponsorship of an evidence-based e-petition addressing the worsening crisis in Canada's permanent residence processing system.

[CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION based on MP's profile - choose ONE of these options:]

OPTION A - High-Immigration Riding:
"Your riding of [Riding Name] has a significant immigrant population experiencing these systemic delays. Many of YOUR constituents are trapped in this processing crisis or know families going through it."

OPTION B - Immigration Committee Member:
"As a member of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, you are uniquely positioned to champion this issue and demand accountability from IRCC."

OPTION C - Opposition MP (Conservative, NDP, Bloc):
"As an Opposition MP, you can hold the Liberal government accountable for this documented failure. This petition provides evidence-based ammunition with no political risk."

OPTION D - Liberal MP:
"As a Liberal MP, you have direct access to Minister Miller to push for reforms from within the government. This petition provides a roadmap for fixing a system your party acknowledges is broken."

[OPTIONAL - PERSONAL SITUATION SECTION]
[Include this section ONLY if you are comfortable sharing your personal story. Many advocates prefer to focus on the broader issue rather than personal details. If you choose to include it, customize with your specific information:]

MY SITUATION:
I have been waiting [X] months for my PR application:
- Applied: [Program name, e.g., BC PNP/FSW/CEC] [Month, Year]
- CSIS screening: [X] months [status: completed/in progress]
- CBSA screening: [X] months [status: past due date/in progress]
- Financial impact: [Brief description, e.g., "$XXX,XXX in excess costs" or "unable to get professional license"]

[Alternatively, you can speak on behalf of affected families generally:]

STORIES FROM AFFECTED FAMILIES:
Families across Canada are experiencing:
- 30-40+ months waiting beyond published service standards
- $130K-$200K per family in excess costs (international tuition, legal fees, temporary status extensions)
- Unable to get professional licenses, start businesses, or sponsor family members
- Years of uncertainty with NO COMMUNICATION from IRCC

THE CRISIS (GOVERNMENT DATA):

The Liberal government broke the processing system:
- PR backlogs: 20% (2023) → 55% (November 2025)
- 515,000 APPLICATIONS STUCK (IRCC, November 30, 2025)
- Applicants wait 30-40+ MONTHS beyond published standards
- NO COMMUNICATION, no accountability, no recourse

The government achieved 20% backlog in 2023—proving the system CAN work—then let it collapse to 55% in just 18 months. This is administrative incompetence.

THE SOLUTION:

This evidence-based petition offers concrete reforms:

1. EXPEDITE BACKLOG: Immediately process 515,000 cases, prioritizing applicants who completed security screening and are waiting beyond standards

2. ACCOUNTABILITY: Require IRCC to provide 90-day case updates; establish service standards with consequences for failures

3. TRANSPARENCY: Quarterly Minister appearances before Standing Committee to explain delays; independent audit of processing disparities

4. INTERIM RELIEF: For applicants waiting 200%+ beyond standards, provide open work permits and ability to sponsor family members

WHY YOUR SPONSORSHIP MATTERS:

✓ Evidence-based (IRCC, Auditor General data) - cannot be dismissed as anecdotal
✓ Addresses systemic failure documented by government's own agencies
✓ Comprehensive solution with specific, achievable demands
✓ Affects 515,000 families - potential for 10,000+ petition signatures nationwide

[IF OPPOSITION MP: Add this]
✓ Opportunity to hold government accountable with formal petition requiring response within 45 days
✓ No political risk - you're championing families who followed the rules

[IF LIBERAL MP: Add this]
✓ Opportunity to push for reforms and help government meet its own service standards
✓ Shows you're listening to constituent concerns and working for solutions

I have attached the complete petition document with all references to official government sources. Every claim is verifiable.

WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SPONSOR THIS PETITION?

If you agree, I can immediately submit the petition through the ourcommons.ca system with your name as sponsor. The petition would then open for 120 days of signatures, be presented in the House of Commons, and require a government response within 45 days.

This petition is part of a grassroots movement documented at chinese-pr-delay.ca. On March 13, 2026, affected families are organizing a peaceful procession to Parliament Hill to demand accountability.

I am available to meet at your convenience or provide any additional information you need.

Thank you for your consideration. Thousands of families who followed the rules and deserve timely decisions are counting on Parliamentary leadership to demand accountability.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Your City, Province, Postal Code]

HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS TEMPLATE:

STEP 1 - RESEARCH THE MP:
□ Look up MP's name, riding, party, and email at ourcommons.ca
□ Check if they serve on Standing Committee for Citizenship and Immigration
□ Review their riding demographics (high immigrant population?)
□ Search for any recent statements on immigration

STEP 2 - CUSTOMIZE THE EMAIL:
□ Replace [MP Name] with actual name
□ Replace [MP's Riding/Community] in subject line
□ Choose OPTION A, B, C, or D based on MP's profile
□ Decide whether to include personal situation (optional)
□ Add Opposition/Liberal-specific bullet points in "Why Your Sponsorship Matters" section
□ Replace [Your Name], [Your Address], [Your Email] with your information

STEP 3 - MP-SPECIFIC ANGLES:
□ Conservative MPs: Emphasize holding Liberals accountable, system collapse, wasted taxpayer resources
□ NDP MPs: Emphasize discrimination, fairness, families suffering, systemic injustice
□ Bloc MPs: Emphasize Quebec applicants affected, federal government failure
□ Liberal MPs: Frame as helping government fix acknowledged problems, constituent service

STEP 4 - STRATEGIC TIPS:
□ Keep email under 600 words if possible (MPs receive hundreds of emails)
□ Use MP's own statements/quotes if you found any during research
□ Emphasize constituent impact if MP represents high-immigration riding
□ For new MPs (elected 2025): mention they have opportunity to make immediate impact
□ Always attach E-Petition_Full_Document_for_MPs.docx

STEP 5 - AFTER SENDING:
□ Follow up after 5-7 business days if no response
□ If MP agrees to sponsor: coordinate timing and provide petition text
□ If MP declines: thank them and consider approaching another MP
□ Track your outreach in a spreadsheet (MP name, date sent, response status)

FINDING CONSTITUENT SUPPORT:
Success rates INCREASE dramatically when a constituent from the MP's riding also emails:
- Find affected PR applicants in the MP's riding
- Have them send similar email emphasizing they are a constituent
- Coordinate timing (both send within 24-48 hours)
- Two-pronged approach (movement organizer + constituent) = 10-15% higher success rate

WHICH MPs TO PRIORITIZE:
TIER 1 (Highest probability):
□ Conservative MPs who have criticized Liberal immigration failures
□ MPs on Standing Committee for Citizenship and Immigration
□ MPs representing ridings with large Chinese/South Asian populations (Richmond Hill, Markham, Scarborough, Surrey, Burnaby)
□ MPs with personal immigration experience or background

TIER 2 (Medium probability):
□ NDP MPs (sympathetic to fairness issues but may not sponsor Opposition petition)
□ New MPs (any party) wanting to show responsiveness
□ MPs who have previously sponsored e-petitions

TIER 3 (Lower probability - only pursue with constituent support):
□ Liberal MPs in high-immigration ridings (won't sponsor but might raise privately)
□ Bloc MPs (if significant Quebec applicants affected)

DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:
✗ Cabinet Ministers (too busy, party loyalists)
✗ Liberal MPs in safe seats with no constituent pressure
✗ MPs with no connection to immigration or your community

FINAL NOTE:
You only need ONE MP to sponsor the petition. Focus your energy on 2-3 high-probability targets rather than mass-emailing dozens of MPs. Quality over quantity.
