teaser: "I came to Canada with my older daughter in 2018. We first submitted our PR application in April 2021, but after 17 months IRCC returned it. We resubmitted in October 2022, and my husband entered security screening in June 2023 — two years later IRCC asked for additional documents, and after that, nothing. During these 7 years my husband applied for visitor visas and work permits, but all were refused. Our family has been separated and our two little kids cannot meet their mother in person. We are facing enormous challenges — not only our marriage but also the growth of our children."

I came to Canada with my older daughter in 2018. Our family submitted our PR application in April 2021. Then after 17 months, IRCC returned our application because they believed the agent had signed for us. In October 2022, we submitted the PR application again. My husband entered security screening from June 2023. Two years later, IRCC asked for additional documents — and after that, nothing.

During these 7 years, my husband applied for visitor visas and work permits, but unfortunately all were refused. Our family has been separated, and our two little kids cannot meet their mother in person.

Our family is facing enormous challenges — not only to our marriage but also to the growth of our children.

Only the final decision can determine when our family can reunite. We urge IRCC to pay attention to the people who are working hard and contributing to Canada.
