Today, I want to share the story of my friend, **Limin Zhang**.

She came to Canada in good faith. Like many of us, she believed in hard work, transparency, and the rule of law. In November 2022, she submitted her permanent residence application, hoping to build a stable future for her family.

For a while, everything seemed normal. In July 2023, she received her Pre-Arrival Letter. In December 2023, official records showed that her security review had been completed. She felt relief. She believed the finish line was near.

But one month later, without explanation, her status reverted. **"Security in progress."** No change in her background. No new information. No reason given. And since then — more than a year has passed. Repeated inquiries. Repeated legal attempts. Repeated confirmations that reviews were completed. Yet the status remains the same.

Limin is not alone. Her story mirrors ours. In our own family, our security stage was marked as completed — only to later be placed back into review again. We followed every rule. We provided every document. We complied with every request. Yet we remain suspended in uncertainty.

This uncertainty is not just administrative. It is deeply personal. Limin's mother is ill overseas, but she cannot leave her job because she is tied to a closed work permit. Her children must pay international tuition fees while waiting for a decision that should have already been made. And in our own family, we are also paying international tuition because of prolonged review. The financial burden is immense. The emotional toll is heavier.

This is not about avoiding safeguards. This is not about bypassing necessary checks. We respect Canada's responsibility to protect national safety. But when completed reviews are reopened without explanation, when timelines disappear, when families live in fear of indefinite delay — the cost becomes human. A system can be secure and fair. A system can be thorough and transparent. We are not asking for privilege. We are asking for clarity. For reasonable timelines. For procedural fairness.

Limin's story is not a single case. It represents many families who are law-abiding, contributing members of this country. Today, we stand here peacefully — not in anger, but in hope. Hope that the system can work as it is meant to work. Hope that fairness and security can coexist.

Thank you.
