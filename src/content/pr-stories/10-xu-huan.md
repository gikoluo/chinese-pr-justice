以下是我的真实经历，我为内容的真实性和准确性负责。尤其是文中提到的PR和小签同时安调，导致在加拿大境内的我无法回国看完生重病年迈的亲人。

**I. Arrival with Hope (2021)**

In 2021, my family arrived in Canada with hope, goodwill, and deep respect for the law.

Like many newcomers, we believed in Canada's values — fairness, dignity, and humanity. We came to study, work, invest, pay taxes, serve the community, and build a future through honest effort. We treated people with kindness and trusted that our goodwill would be met with fairness.

As of March 2026, that trust has been profoundly shaken.

**II. Indefinite and Prolonged Security Screening**

As of March 2026:

- **Permanent Residence (PR) application:** pending 35 months
- **PR security screening:** ongoing 25 months
- **Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) security screening:** ongoing 12 months

There has been no clear explanation, no timeline, and no meaningful accountability.

This is not a routine delay. It is an indefinite suspension of a family's life.

**III. Humanitarian Consequences**

**1. Forced Separation from a Gravely Ill Parent**

My elderly parent in China is seriously ill. As a son, I have a moral duty to return and be present.

However, because I live legally inside Canada — working and contributing — yet cannot obtain a valid re-entry visa, I am effectively trapped.

- Leaving Canada risks losing my livelihood and future.
- Staying means abandoning my family in their most vulnerable moment.

This form of security screening operates in practice as an indefinite travel ban, imposed on a lawful resident without explanation or end date.

It is not security. It is inhumane forced separation.

**2. Life in Permanent Uncertainty and Psychological Harm**

Indefinite PR security screening destroys a family's ability to plan: housing and settlement, career development, children's education, financial stability and investment.

Living for years without certainty has caused constant anxiety, insomnia, and psychological exhaustion. Every day is lived in limbo.

No family should be forced to exist indefinitely without answers.

**3. Severe Financial and Educational Damage**

Our child attends a Canadian university as an international student. International tuition represents decades of savings. Ongoing security screening blocks access to programs and careers that require Canadian status. Our child cannot freely plan education or future employment.

This is not only financial loss — it is lost opportunity, lost time, and lost dignity.

**IV. Systemic Harm Beyond One Family**

Conducting duplicated security screenings on the same individual across both PR and TRV applications creates unnecessary harm: waste of public resources, increased backlogs for others, reduced efficiency within the immigration system, and damage to public trust in government fairness.

When procedures lose proportionality, individuals suffer — and institutions weaken.

**V. A Call for Humanity and Accountability**

We are not asking for special treatment. We are asking for:

- Humanity in decision-making
- Proportionality in security processes
- Accountability when delays become indefinite

Families like mine came to Canada with trust. We remain here — contributing, waiting, and hoping — but increasingly broken by silence.

Security should protect society, not quietly destroy families.

Canada can do better. And we are asking — peacefully and publicly — for it to do so.
