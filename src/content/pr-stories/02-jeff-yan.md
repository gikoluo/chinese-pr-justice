My journey to secure permanent residency in Canada has turned into a nightmare of bureaucratic inaction and inexplicable delays. I submitted my federal application in November 2022, hoping for a new beginning for my family.

For a while, everything seemed to be on track. In July 2023, I received my Pre-Arrival Letter (PAL). Then came the crucial breakthrough: according to the official Tracker and CBSA notes, my Security Screening passed on December 8, 2023, with a validity date set until December 7, 2025. I felt relief, believing the finish line was near.

However, that relief was short-lived. On January 29, 2024, without any justification or change in my circumstances, my status inexplicably reverted to "Security in Progress" according to CBSA notes.

What followed has been over a year of frustration. I have had to file two Mandamus applications, both of which were dismissed. Despite complaints to CSIS confirming they completed their screening on March 5, 2025, IRCC continues to ignore the facts. I have sent countless emails to CBSA executives, only to receive the same automated, template replies stating "security in progress." Even interventions by two different Members of Parliament have yielded no results, only empty assurances.

I am an English major with an MBA, worked in the private sector in import/export for auto parts and agricultural fertilizer. I have never traveled to sensitive countries, and my family has no background that would warrant this scrutiny. I am caught in a loop of repeated security screenings for no apparent reason, and IRCC refuses to explain why a passed security check was disregarded.

The impact on my life has been devastating:

**Mental Toll:** The extreme uncertainty has caused immense mental and emotional distress.

**Family Separation:** My mother is ill, but because I am on a closed work permit, I cannot leave my job to return to China to care for her.

**Financial Strain:** Because my status remains pending, both of my children are forced to pay international student tuition fees, placing a massive burden on our family.

I am demanding that IRCC and CBSA stop this injustice, address the facts of my case, and finalize my application immediately.
