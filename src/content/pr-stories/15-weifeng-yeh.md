**25 Months in Limbo: When Tracking Car Seat Foam Becomes a "National Security Threat," Why Is My Canadian Dream Stalled?**

It's been over 25 months since I submitted my Permanent Resident application. For the last 13 months, my family's life has been completely frozen in "Comprehensive Security Screening." Although I fully respect Canada's emphasis on national security, being stuck in an indefinite investigation for someone with my background feels confusing and helpless.

For 20 years, my IT career has been strictly in the private, traditional manufacturing sector. My work does not involve any sensitive data or military technology. My software is solely used to manage the flow of physical materials — specifically metal reeds, electrical contacts, plastic particles, copper wires, and foam padding. These materials are used to manufacture North American UL-certified electronic components or ordinary car seats. What is the national security threat in tracking foam padding and plastic particles? Instead of targeting actual risks, this open-ended screening is trapping ordinary professionals, revealing a process unable to tell the difference between a civilian factory and a real threat.

This prolonged delay also directly affects my daughter. Today, she is 16 and a half years old, having spent the past 4.5 years living continuously in Canada. She considers this her permanent home. Yet, while her high school peers are securing part-time jobs and gaining independence, she is legally barred from obtaining a Social Insurance Number (SIN). From her perspective, this system is teaching her a cruel lesson: that Canada is a country that divides people into different classes. In school, she is taught the Canadian values of equality and inclusion, but in reality, institutional barriers force her to live as a marginalized, lower-tier resident. This stark contradiction is quietly crushing a hardworking teenager's faith in the very country she wants to belong to.
