teaser: "I submitted my PR application on August 26, 2022. Security screening began in December 2023. CSIS sent its security advice to IRCC on August 5, 2025—yet as of February 2026 there is still no final decision. Over 42 months of waiting. As a single mother I am solely responsible for my two sons, my elderly parents (now over 80), and our household. My eldest son pays international tuition; my partner (a Canadian citizen) and I cannot plan our future. I have filed two Mandamus applications and contacted my MP five times. I am not asking for special treatment—only for fairness, transparency, and timely processing."

## My Timeline

PR application submitted August 26, 2022 → Security screening since December 2023 → CSIS sent security advice to IRCC on August 5, 2025 → February 2026 still no final decision → 42+ months waiting → Son paying international tuition; partner (Canadian citizen) affected; parents (80+) left without support → Two Mandamus filings (January 2025 & August 29, 2025).

## Impact on My Family, Career, and Finances

As a single mother, the prolonged delay in my permanent residence application has created deep and far-reaching hardship across every part of my life. I am solely responsible for supporting my two sons, caring for my elderly parents, and maintaining our household, yet my ability to provide stability has been severely undermined by more than 42 months of uncertainty.

The unresolved PR status has placed enormous financial pressure on our family. My eldest son began university in September 2025 but must pay international student tuition, a burden I must shoulder alone as the only income provider. The delay also prevents me from accessing more stable career opportunities or planning long-term financial decisions, while repeated legal costs, ATIP requests, and two Mandamus filings continue to accumulate without any progress from IRCC.

My family life has been equally affected. I have been living with my partner, a Canadian citizen, since December 2023, yet we cannot plan our future—housing, finances, and long-term commitments all remain frozen. At the same time, my parents are now over 80 years old. As their only child, I face constant emotional stress because I cannot make decisions about their care, support, or potential reunification. My children also feel this uncertainty, worrying about both their grandparents and our future in Canada.

Emotionally, the prolonged limbo has caused persistent stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. As a single mother, I must remain strong for my children, but the lack of clarity from IRCC makes it increasingly difficult to provide them with the stability and reassurance they deserve. Even after CSIS confirmed on August 5, 2025 that its security advice had already been provided to IRCC, my application remains stalled with no explanation.

## What I Want the Government to Know

I want the government to understand that this delay is not just an administrative backlog—it is a deeply human issue that affects every part of my life as a single mother who carries the full responsibility for my children, my elderly parents, and our future in Canada.

For more than 42 months, I have lived in uncertainty despite doing everything required of me. I submitted all documents, responded to every request, filed eight ATIP applications, contacted my MP five times, and filed two Mandamus applications. I have followed every rule and complied fully with the process. Yet my life remains frozen without explanation, even after CSIS confirmed that its security screening advice was already provided to IRCC on August 5, 2025.

I am not asking for special treatment—only for fairness, transparency, and timely processing. I hope the government will recognize the human impact of these delays and take meaningful action to ensure that applications like mine are reviewed and finalized without further unnecessary delay.
