In the summer of 2021, my family and I walked out of the airport in Canada with heavy suitcases and big hopes. We honestly believed we were starting over.

It took time to understand we'd stepped into something else—a long season of "security screening." The door isn't locked, but somehow you still can't leave.

The first months were tough and messy: new country, new language, new routines, and a winter that doesn't forgive. Eventually we found our footing. From the outside it might sound like an immigration story. From the inside it was simply life—one day after another.

And yes, it's cold here. But people can be unexpectedly warm. When my car got stuck in the snow, strangers pulled over and pushed me out. During a power outage, a neighbour knocked with candles and a lighter. Once we came back from a short trip and found our lawn quietly mowed. Small kindness doesn't fix the big problems, but it keeps you going.

In October 2022, our provincial nomination was approved. In November 2022, we submitted our federal PR application. I truly believed the hardest part was behind us.

In February 2023, we got our file number. The relief felt real—like things finally clicked into place. For a few days, I let myself dream: once the PR card arrives, I'll fly home. Let my child see the grandparents. Share a simple meal. Sit on that old couch and do nothing. I didn't want a grand reunion—I just wanted to go back once and make up for the time we'd missed.

Then in June 2023, security screening began. On paper it sounds procedural. In real life it becomes one word: waiting. At first you guess—six months, a year. Later you stop guessing. You stop asking. You stop planning.

The hardest part isn't even the delay. It's the uncertainty. No timeline means life becomes impossible to schedule. We don't dare buy plane tickets. We don't even dare let "going home" become a real plan—because one unexpected request, one small change at work, one tiny shift in circumstances can make everything feel fragile again.

So we live in an in-between: we work, pay taxes, pay rent, raise our child, smile at strangers—yet we're never fully settled. It feels like standing on a threshold: not completely in, and not really able to leave. At first you think you're waiting for a result. After a while you realize you're putting your life on pause, piece by piece.

When we left home, we told our family, "Once we get PR, we'll come back to visit." We believed it.

At the end of 2023, my father passed away. I didn't make it home in time to see him one last time. Real life doesn't give you a goodbye scene—no last hug, no last words. Just a message, and a distance you can't close.

That's when "32 months" stopped being a number. It became time taken from family.

For my wife, nearly five years without going home has become a constant restraint: without PR she can't take long leave; she worries about her job and work permit renewals; she worries one small change could undo years of effort. It's not that we don't want to go home—we're scared to risk what we've built.

Some winter nights I drive through the City. Rock music plays—songs about freedom and open roads. And I catch myself thinking: sometimes freedom is only local. You can move around, keep life organized, even take a spontaneous weekend trip… and still not reach the one place you truly want to reach.

People say immigration is a fresh start. I've come to feel it's also a long unbuilding—of language, confidence, control, and the belief that "we'll have time."

If the PR card finally arrives, I don't think I'll celebrate. I'll probably stare at the mail for a long time. Then I'll pour a small drink for my dad. Even if he's gone, I still want to tell him: I made it this far.

The wind is still blowing. Canadian winters are still cold. And I'm still waiting—for an ending, and for a chance to make "going home" real again.
