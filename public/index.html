            <h2>Declaration of Justice</h2>
            <div class="declaration-content">
                <div class="declaration-text">
                    <h3>We Stand for Fair Immigration Processing</h3>
                    <p>We are Chinese immigrants, students, workers, and families who have followed every rule, paid every fee, and waited patiently for our Permanent Residence applications to be processed. Yet we face unprecedented delays of 3-5+ years due to prolonged security screening.</p>

                    <h3>We Declare That:</h3>
                    <ul class="declaration-list">
                        <li><strong>Equality:</strong> We deserve the same processing standards and timelines as applicants from other countries. Current delays disproportionately affect Chinese applicants.</li>

                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We have the right to know why security screening takes 3-5+ years when all admissibility requirements are already met. We deserve clear explanations, not indefinite silence.</li>

                        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Security screening should not be used as a tool for discrimination. Thorough security checks are reasonable; indefinite delays without explanation are not.</li>

                        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> IRCC's pattern of missed deadlines and broken promises shows systematic failure. We demand accountability for these delays that destroy lives and futures.</li>

                        <li><strong>Human Dignity:</strong> We are not case numbers. We are human beings with families, careers, children, and dreams. Our lives are on hold while bureaucracy fails us.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Human Cost</h3>
                    <p>These delays have severe consequences:</p>
                    <ul class="impact-list">
                        <li>Children lose eligibility for domestic tuition ($130,000-200,000 per child)</li>
                        <li>Families cannot reunite with elderly parents</li>
                        <li>Careers are stalled and opportunities lost</li>
                        <li>Mental health suffers from years of uncertainty</li>
                        <li>Work permits expire, forcing families to leave Canada</li>
                        <li>Repeated medical exams and police certificates cost thousands</li>
                    </ul>

                            <h3>Chunhui Luo's Story</h3>
                            <p class="story-location">BC PNP Applicant • 3.5+ Years Waiting</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="story-content">
                        <p>I applied for PR through BC PNP over 3 years ago. Everything passed - eligibility, criminality, medical. Only security screening remains. My file has a pattern of missed deadlines documented in my CBSA notes. Every "due date" IRCC sets gets ignored.</p>

                        <p><strong>The impact on my family:</strong> My son is in Grade 11, applying to universities next year. Without PR, he'll pay international tuition - $40,000-60,000 per year instead of $8,000-15,000. That's a $130,000-180,000 difference for his degree.</p>

                        <p>UBC just repealed domestic tuition for work permit holders in May 2025. Our work permits don't help anymore. <strong>PR is the ONLY solution.</strong></p>

                        <p>My work permit expires October 2026. If PR isn't approved, my entire family may be forced to leave Canada - the place my son calls home, where he's built his life.</p>

                        <p class="story-quote">"We followed every rule. We did everything right. Yet we're treated like we don't deserve basic fairness. My son's future is being destroyed by bureaucratic delays."</p>
