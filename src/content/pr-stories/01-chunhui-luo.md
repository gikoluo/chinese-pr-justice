teaser: "I applied for PR through BC PNP over 3.5 years ago. All requirements passed—eligibility, criminality, medical. Only security screening remains. My CBSA notes document a pattern of missed deadlines. Now my son faces $130,000-200,000 in extra tuition costs because our work permits don't qualify for domestic rates anymore."
quote: "We followed every rule. We paid every fee. We waited patiently. Yet we're treated like we don't deserve basic fairness. My son's future is being destroyed by bureaucratic delays and what feels like systematic discrimination. After 40 months, 'patience' is no longer enough. We demand action."
timeline: "Applied BC PNP Aug 2022 → All passed by mid-2023 → Security screening begins → June 6, 2026 deadline (from MP) → July 2026 update expected (not guaranteed) → Work permits expire Oct 2026 → Son applies to universities Fall 2026 → University starts Fall 2027"

**My name is Chunhui Luo.** I applied for Permanent Residence through BC PNP in August 2022 — over 3.5 years ago. I followed every rule, submitted every document, paid every fee. All admissibility requirements passed: **Eligibility ✓ Criminality ✓ Medical ✓** Only security screening remains — and it has consumed over 40 months of my life.

**The Pattern of Broken Promises:** My CBSA notes document a disturbing pattern of missed deadlines. IRCC sets "due dates" then ignores them. The latest deadline is June 6, 2026. My MP was told I "may receive a potential update in July 2026, but this is not guaranteed." After 40+ months, even IRCC won't commit to their own deadlines.

**My Son's Education Crisis:** My son is in Grade 11. He will apply to Canadian universities in Fall 2026 for Fall 2027 admission. Without PR, he faces international tuition: **$40,000-65,000 per year**. With PR, domestic tuition is **$7,000-15,000 per year**. Over 4 years, that's a difference of **$130,000-200,000**.

**Our Backup Plan Collapsed:** I hold a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP) because my PR application is pending. Until May 2025, UBC offered domestic tuition to work permit holders' dependents. But UBC repealed that policy effective May 1, 2025. I researched every top Canadian university — UBC, SFU, U of T, McGill, McMaster, Waterloo, Western, Queen's. **My BOWP doesn't qualify at a single one.** They all require closed work permits with provincial employers. PR is the ONLY way my son can access domestic tuition.

**The October 2026 Deadline:** My work permit and my son's study permit expire in October 2026. If PR isn't approved, we must apply for extension or leave Canada — the country my son calls home. Even with extension, it won't solve the tuition problem. My son has excellent grades and would qualify for $50,000-150,000 in domestic scholarships — but only if we have PR.

**Why Is This Happening?** IRCC's own posted processing time is **12 months** (updated January 14, 2026). I am at **40+ months** — over three times that standard — with no explanation. Official data shows the system is in crisis: the PR backlog has grown from the 20% target achieved in 2023 to **55%** by November 2025, and promised reforms have not reversed it. Independent oversight reports and Federal Court cases have documented that many applicants face extreme delays far beyond service standards, with no transparent information and no meaningful recourse. I am one of those applicants — and I still have no answer from IRCC as to why.

**What I'm Asking For:** I'm not asking for special treatment. I'm asking for *equal treatment*. I'm asking for transparency about what security concerns remain after 40 months when I've already passed every other check. I'm asking for my son to have the same opportunities as other Canadian kids — to attend university without his family being bankrupted or deported.
