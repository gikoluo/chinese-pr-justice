teaser: "I am the primary applicant of a PNP program under the business investment pathway — and a mom with a teenage daughter and an 11-year-old son. I have fulfilled all requirements with more than qualified investment and continuous contributions to local business and community. My husband had to remain in China to care for his parent with stage III cancer and support us financially. I have been carrying the burden of raising two children and running a small business alone for three years. There has been no update from IRCC since April 2024 — the silence is like a black hole hanging over my family and sucking our hope for a clear family reunion plan."
quote: "This prolonged security screening process is unfair and lacks justification and transparency. There is no reason explained, no response and no deadline. It is a torture for applicants and their families with great hope and expectations for this country."

I am the primary applicant of a PNP program under the business investment pathway. I am also a mom with a teenage daughter and an 11-year-old son. I have fulfilled all requirements from my immigration program with more than qualified investment and continuous contributions to local business and community.

**Impact on Our Family**

I have been suffering from enormous burden to take care of my two children as well as my small business alone in Canada for the past three years. My husband had to remain in China to take care of his parent with stage III cancer and also support us financially.

My children are suffering from the loss of quality time with their father, which undermines their emotional stability and sense of security.

There has been no update from IRCC since April 2024. The silence is like a black hole hanging over my family and sucking our hope for a clear family reunion plan.

My daughter is going to college this September. Without PR, the international student tuition is a huge financial burden for the family.

**What I Want the Government to Know**

This prolonged security screening process is unfair and lacks justification and transparency. There is no reason explained, no response and no deadline in between. It is a torture for applicants and their families with great hope and expectations for this country.
