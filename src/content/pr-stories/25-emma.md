I submitted my Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) permanent residence application through Express Entry as an inland applicant in 2024. As of today, the application has been in process for approximately 15 months, with no substantive update. I have been living in Canada continuously since 2019. I completed my studies in Canada and, following graduation, have worked continuously for my current employer for several years.

My PNP nomination includes an employment restriction. As a result, my bridging work permit is a closed work permit, fully binding me to my current employer. This restriction prevents me from changing employers, even when the working environment becomes increasingly stressful. While I continue to meet all employment and immigration requirements, the lack of mobility has had a serious impact on my mental well-being.

I have contacted IRCC multiple times regarding the status of my application. While the responses have been polite and consistent, they have not provided meaningful clarity. The following is a hypothetical but representative exchange illustrating this experience:

**Applicant:** May I know if there is any update on my permanent residence application?  
**Agent:** Your application is in progress. We do not require any additional information from you at this time.

**Applicant:** The standard processing time for Express Entry is six months. My application has now exceeded the standard timeframe (~15 months). May I know approximately how much longer it may take?  
**Agent:** Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a timeline. Please wait patiently.

**Applicant:** My job is not secure, and I may be affected by layoffs this year. This makes me very anxious, as my permanent residence application is based on a job offer and my work permit is closed.  
**Agent:** We understand your concern; however, we are unable to provide a timeline. At this moment, no action is required from you.

**Applicant:** I am willing to wait, but if I lose my job due to circumstances beyond my control, my ongoing PR application may be lost. This is especially distressing because, under normal processing times, my PR should have been finalized about a year ago.  
**Agent:** Unfortunately, we are unable to provide a timeline.

This type of interaction creates significant emotional strain for applicants whose permanent residence applications are fully dependent on continued employment. When processing times extend far beyond published standards, applicants are left in a prolonged state of uncertainty without any practical way to mitigate risk.

For individuals with employment-restricted nominations, a closed bridging work permit further limits their ability to respond to unexpected employment changes. If their position is eliminated due to company reorganization, budget cuts, or other uncontrollable factors, they may lose both their legal status and their permanent residence application simultaneously—despite having complied fully with all requirements.

This prolonged uncertainty also affects long-term planning. Applicants may be unable to pursue further education, change career paths, or make personal and family decisions while their future remains unresolved.

Applicants whose permanent residence applications are directly tied to employment face a unique and often overlooked form of psychological stress. Extended processing times combined with restrictive work permits can unintentionally place these individuals in a highly vulnerable position. Greater transparency, flexibility, or protective measures in such cases would help ensure that applicants are not unfairly penalized for delays beyond their control.
