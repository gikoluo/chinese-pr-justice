## The Story of My Continuing Education Delayed by Immigration Processing

I am a young software engineer based in Ottawa. Unlike many others, after earning my Canadian credential, I did not immediately continue working in a field directly related to my original area of study. Instead, driven by my passion for computers and coding, I taught myself and eventually, in 2022, secured a full-time software engineering position at a local tech company in Ottawa.

I love the community where I live. I take part in local activities such as volunteering at the food bank. I am also deeply passionate about my profession and hope to create value for my community and for this country through the field I love.

I submitted my immigration application in December 2022, and since then, I have received no updates. At the same time, as my work experience has grown, I have realized that if I want to make greater progress in the field of software development and truly support my long-term career goals, pursuing a master's degree has become essential.

I began preparing my application materials in 2023. However, in every application cycle, I have had to step back because my current immigration status requires me to pay extremely high international student tuition fees. My application documents have gone through many revisions, but due to the immigration delays, to this day I still have not had the opportunity to submit my applications.

The impact of this delay extends beyond just my career aspirations. Without permanent residency, I am unable to access the same educational opportunities that would allow me to contribute more meaningfully to Canada's tech sector. The financial burden of international tuition fees makes pursuing advanced education impossible, even though I am already contributing to the Canadian economy and community.

I am asking for transparency and action from IRCC. After 38 months of waiting with no updates, I deserve to know the status of my application and when I can expect a resolution. My future, my career growth, and my ability to contribute more to this country I call home are all being held hostage by bureaucratic delays.
