I haven't been home to see my parents in almost 7 years: 3 years of COVID, 1 year for provincial nomination, then security screening until now. I have no family or relatives here. My girlfriend left me during this time. I'm afraid to change jobs, under huge pressure almost every day, and I've lost opportunities to become an assistant professor because I cannot leave my current province."

I submitted my permanent residence application on August 4, 2023, and entered security screening in March 2024. Since then, there has been no feedback. It has been over 23 months since the security check began, and over 30 months since my application submission.

**Impact on My Life**

This endless screening has had a devastating impact on every aspect of my life. Because of this process, I haven't been back home to see my parents for almost 7 years — 3 years of COVID, 1 year waiting for provincial nomination, then security screening until now. I have no family, no relatives here, and my girlfriend also left me during this time.

I am afraid to change jobs and live under a huge amount of pressure almost every day. I have lost multiple opportunities to become an assistant professor, since I cannot leave my current province.

**What I Want the Government to Know**

I need a clear decision on my application as soon as possible. Although I work in computer science, which may be considered a sensitive field, I have no sensitive work or study experience. The security check asked for a one-page resume — and it has taken over two years with no result.

I believed in Canada during the dark time of COVID and chose to stay. I am asking for the same faith in return: transparency, accountability, and a timely decision.
