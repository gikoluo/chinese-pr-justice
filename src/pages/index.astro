                <div class="declaration-intro">
                    <h3>We Stand for Fair Immigration Processing</h3>
                    <p>We are Chinese immigrants, students, workers, and families who have followed every rule, paid every fee, and waited patiently for our Permanent Residence applications to be processed. Yet we face unprecedented delays of 40+ months due to prolonged security screening—while IRCC's estimated processing time is 12 months (last updated: January 14, 2026).</p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="declaration-subtitle">We Declare That:</h3>
                <ul class="declaration-list declaration-grid">
                    <li><strong>Equality:</strong> We deserve the same processing standards and timelines as applicants from other countries. Current delays disproportionately affect Chinese applicants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We have the right to know why security screening takes 3-5+ years when all admissibility requirements are already met. We deserve clear explanations, not indefinite silence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> Security screening should not be used as a tool for discrimination. Thorough security checks are reasonable; indefinite delays without explanation are not.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> IRCC's pattern of missed deadlines and broken promises shows systematic failure. We demand accountability for these delays that destroy lives and futures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Dignity:</strong> We are not case numbers. We are human beings with families, careers, children, and dreams. Our lives are on hold while bureaucracy fails us.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="declaration-subtitle">The Human Cost</h3>
                <p class="declaration-impact-intro">These delays have severe consequences:</p>
                <ul class="impact-list impact-grid">
                    <li>Children lose eligibility for domestic tuition ($130,000-200,000 per child)</li>
                    <li>Families cannot reunite with elderly parents</li>
                    <li>Careers are stalled and opportunities lost</li>
                    <li>Mental health suffers from years of uncertainty</li>
                    <li>Work permits expire, forcing families to leave Canada</li>
                    <li>Repeated medical exams and police certificates cost thousands</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="declaration-conclusion"><strong>We have waited long enough. We demand action now.</strong></p>
