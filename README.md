# Justice for PR Applicants

**End Discriminatory Security Screening Delays for Chinese Permanent Residence Applicants in Canada**

---

## The Problem

Thousands of Chinese PR applicants in Canada are trapped in indefinite security screening delays. While IRCC's own estimated processing time is **12 months** (last updated January 14, 2026), many applicants have been waiting **40+ months** with no explanation, no communication, and no end in sight.

Every deadline IRCC sets is missed. Every inquiry receives a generic response. Every promise is broken.

## Who We Are

We are Chinese immigrants, students, workers, and families who followed every rule, paid every fee, and waited patiently. We applied through legitimate programs -- BC PNP, Express Entry, Family Sponsorship, and others. We passed eligibility, criminality, and medical checks. Only "security screening" remains -- and it has consumed years of our lives.

## The Human Cost

These are not abstract numbers. These are real consequences:

- **Children lose access to domestic tuition** -- paying $40,000-60,000/year instead of $8,000-15,000, a difference of $130,000-200,000 per degree
- **Families cannot reunite** with elderly parents who may not survive the wait
- **Careers are destroyed** -- promotions lost, businesses abandoned, professional licenses expired
- **Work permits expire** -- forcing families to leave the country they call home
- **Mental health deteriorates** from years of uncertainty and powerlessness
- **Thousands of dollars wasted** on repeated medical exams and police certificates that expire during the delay

## Our 8 Demands

We call on the Canadian Government, the Immigration Minister, and IRCC to act:

1. **Immediate Processing** -- Complete all security screenings for cases pending over 2 years within 90 days
2. **Equal Treatment** -- End discriminatory processing that disproportionately targets Chinese applicants
3. **Transparency & Communication** -- Provide clear explanations for delays beyond 6 months, not generic responses
4. **Accountability for Delays** -- Establish enforceable timelines with consequences for non-compliance
5. **Humanitarian Consideration** -- Expedite cases involving children in school, expiring permits, elderly parents, medical emergencies
6. **Temporary Measures** -- Grant domestic tuition eligibility and temporary PR benefits while screening completes
7. **Mandamus Reform** -- Stop using "national security" as a blanket shield to dismiss legitimate court challenges
8. **Public Apology** -- The Minister must acknowledge the disproportionate impact and commit to concrete solutions
