My journey in Canada began in 2008, when I arrived as an international student to pursue post‑secondary education. After graduating, I entered the Canadian workforce, became a taxpayer, and eventually made Toronto my permanent home. Together with my husband, I have built my family and my life here.

As the only child in my family, I submitted a permanent residence application for my parents under the Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship Program. The application was received on November 1, 2021, and as of February 2026, no final decision has been made. The delay is due to an extended security screening process that began in January 2023.

Over these years, I have watched my parents age from afar and have witnessed the emotional toll that prolonged uncertainty has placed on them. The situation has also deeply affected my own family, especially as my parents have been unable to visit Canada—even temporarily—to see me or their grandchild. The visitor visa refusals tied to the ongoing security screening have left us in a painful and isolating position.

My family are long‑standing, high‑contributing residents of Ontario. In the 2024 tax year alone, we contributed approximately C$120,000 in personal income tax. Yet despite fulfilling every obligation expected of us as residents and taxpayers, we continue to face an indefinite delay that prevents basic family reunification.

The lack of transparency and the extraordinary length of the security screening process create a system that feels fundamentally inequitable. When delays disproportionately affect applicants from specific communities—such as the Chinese community—the impact becomes more than administrative. It becomes discriminatory in effect, even if not in intent. No Canadian resident should be placed in a position where their parents are effectively barred from visiting or joining them because of opaque and unreasonably prolonged procedures.

After more than 52 months of waiting, I am asking IRCC for transparency, accountability, and action. Canadians deserve a system that protects national security while also respecting fairness, clarity, and human dignity. We need a process that allows families to stay connected and that reinforces trust in our institutions—not one that leaves families in limbo without information or recourse.

I respectfully request that IRCC provide clear communication regarding the status of the security screening, expected timelines, and any steps that can be taken to resolve the delay. A balanced system—one that safeguards security while upholding transparency—is essential for maintaining confidence in Canada's immigration framework.

Family reunification is a core Canadian value. It should not be compromised by bureaucratic opacity or disproportionate delays.
