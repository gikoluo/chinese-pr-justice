Hello everyone, my name is **Jingjing Wen**. I am a resident here, a parent, and someone who believed deeply in Canada's system of fairness.

I want to tell you about a single moment. Not the entire process. Not all the paperwork. Just one moment.

In December 2024, I opened the immigration tracker and saw **four green check marks.** All stages completed. Background verification — completed. Later, official notes confirmed: security — passed. For the first time in a long time, we allowed ourselves to breathe. We told our child, "It's almost done." We began to plan. We even looked at school options and future housing again. We believed we had reached the finish line.

Then, in February 2025, without warning, the tracker changed. The green turned blue. **"Background verification — in progress."** No request for documents. No new information. No explanation. Just… back. Back to uncertainty. Back to silence. Back to waiting. That was the moment everything changed.

It is difficult to explain what that does to a family. You begin to question every decision. You stop making plans. You stop talking about the future. My husband had been admitted into Ontario teacher education programs. Because our status was not finalized, he must pay international tuition. The financial burden is severe. But the mental burden is worse. For more than six months, he has needed sleeping pills just to fall asleep. We have spent thousands on psychological counselling. Not because we failed a requirement. Not because we broke the law. But because a completed stage was reopened without explanation.

We filed access requests. We asked for clarification. We followed every legal channel. There is no timeline. There is no answer. There is no way to respond.

We respect Canada's need to ensure safety. But when hope is repeatedly given and then taken away, when the system provides no transparency, families live in a permanent state of suspension. This is not about anger. It is about stability. It is about the basic human need to know where you stand.

We are here today peacefully because we still believe that security and fairness can coexist. We are asking for clarity. We are asking for reasonable timelines. We are asking for a system that does not pull families back from the finish line without explanation.

Thank you.
