**Dear Officer,**

I am writing to formally demand a final decision regarding my application for Permanent Residence, which was received by IRCC on August 9, 2022. As of today, this application has been pending for 42 months. According to my latest GCMS records and official Privacy Act disclosures, the security sub-activity has been stagnant for an unreasonable period. This extraordinary delay far exceeds the standard processing times for the Provincial Nominee Program (PV2) and meets the criteria for "unreasonable delay" as established by the Federal Court in Conway v. Canada (MCI).

**1. Definitive Proof of CSIS Completion**

I have received official confirmation from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) stating that CSIS completed its portion of my security screening on July 16, 2025. Despite the primary security agency concluding its assessment over seven months ago, IRCC has failed to render a final decision. This confirms that the continued delay is purely administrative and lacks any justifiable legal or security basis.

**2. Severe Financial and Educational Hardship**

The continued delay is causing irreparable prejudice to my family's future in Canada:

- **Academic Excellence:** My child, LUO YIHAN, ranked in the Top 1% globally (Group IV Honour Roll) in the 2025 Canadian Senior Mathematics Contest hosted by the University of Waterloo. We are currently preparing for the Fall 2027 intake at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Without PR status, the tuition disparity (approx. $45,000/year vs. $6,000/year) creates a $150,000+ penalty that directly threatens my child's access to top-tier Canadian education.

- **Significant Economic Contribution:** Our family consists of high-contributing residents of British Columbia. In the 2024 tax year, our combined total family income was over $200K, and we contributed a total of $60K in income tax to the Canadian government. It is fundamentally inequitable to deny domestic status to a family whose substantial taxes actively fund the very public institutions we are being barred from.

I sincerely hope to resolve this matter administratively and look forward to your prompt response.

**Sincerely,**  
Luo
