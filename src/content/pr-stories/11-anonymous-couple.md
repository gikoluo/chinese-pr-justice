My partner and I applied for permanent residence in May 2023. In August 2023, my application entered security screening with CSIS and CBSA. Since then, it has remained "in progress" for over two and a half years, with no requests for additional documents, no explanations, and no timeline.

For more than 29 months, we have simply been waiting in silence.

During this time, we have done everything asked of us. We have complied with every requirement, paid our taxes, worked full-time, and built our lives in Canada. We are a same-sex couple who chose Canada because of its values of fairness, safety, and equality. We believed that if we followed the rules and contributed to society, the system would treat us with basic transparency and respect.

Instead, we have been left in limbo.

This delay has affected every part of our lives:

- **Financially** – We purchased a pre-construction home years ago to build our future here, but without PR status we now face the risk of hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional taxes and penalties.
- **Professionally** – Career planning is nearly impossible when we do not know whether our status will be resolved.
- **Emotionally** – The hardest part is the uncertainty. There are no updates, no accountability, and no one who can explain what is happening. It feels like our lives are paused indefinitely.

We have contacted IRCC, CBSA, the Prime Minister's Office, and ministerial offices. Each department tells us the other is responsible. We receive template responses, but no meaningful information.

We understand the importance of security screening and respect Canada's need to protect public safety. We are not asking for shortcuts. We are simply asking for reasonable timelines, transparency, and basic communication.

No family should have to live for years without knowing when their life can move forward.

We hope the government recognizes that behind every "in progress" file is a real person, a real family, and real consequences.
