My husband's work permit application has been under security screening and marked as non-routine for 13 months with no decision. Because of this, our entire PR process has been paused after receiving the PAL in August 2025. He planned to come to Canada to reunite with me and our son; my son and I have been living in Canada for over three years. We love Canada and have built our life here, but the prolonged uncertainty has forced our family plans on hold. We hope for transparency, clear timelines, and fair treatment for families who call Canada home.

Best regards,  
Songzhen Xiong
