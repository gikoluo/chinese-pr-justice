## A Physician's Dream Stalled by Administrative Dysfunction: A Petition to Canada's Immigration System from an International Medical Graduate

I am an International Medical Graduate from China currently facing the most significant challenge of my career. This struggle is not born of a lack of medical expertise or professional competence, but rather from the profound administrative dysfunction marked by excessive delays and a lack of transparency within Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

I have completed every professional milestone required to serve the Canadian community: I have successfully passed the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) qualifying examinations, received MD equivalence from the Collège des médecins du Québec (CMQ), and am a Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada (LMCC). Furthermore, through my clinical observership in the Department of Medical Genetics at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), I had the opportunity to shadow senior clinicians and gain firsthand insight into the Canadian healthcare system. This experience also allowed me to witness, from a clinical perspective, the desperate need for specialized medical services.

Despite these qualifications, my immigration application has been stalled for 13 months with no end in sight. This administrative inefficiency has triggered a devastating chain reaction: because my Permanent Residency (PR) status remains unapproved, I am barred from the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). Consequently, I was forced to miss the 2025 residency application cycle and am now on the verge of missing the 2026 cycle as well.

As a physician, my deepest regret is this: while I should be in a hospital saving lives, I am forced away from the front lines by administrative paralysis. This is not just a personal loss; it is a profound waste of Canadian public health resources. I am currently unable to fulfill my vocation to heal, nor can I contribute my skills as a high-value professional to Canada's socio-economic fabric.

Canada is currently gripped by a severe physician shortage. By 2030, the deficit of clinical geneticists is projected to be 1.7 times the current capacity; in Quebec alone, 35% of senior practitioners in this field are nearing retirement. I have a deep affinity for Canada. As a doctor in the prime of my career, I am eager to enter the clinical front lines, alleviate the suffering of patients languishing on waiting lists, and give back to society through my expertise.

I am not asking for special treatment. I am simply asking for a fair, transparent, and reasonable processing timeline. Please do not let bureaucratic dysfunction become the "career-ender" for a physician who only wishes to serve the health of this nation.
