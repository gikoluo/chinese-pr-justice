Our family submitted our permanent residence (PR) application in May 2023, and we are still waiting for a final decision from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

As the main applicant, I passed all four stages of assessment very quickly. However, my husband and our 7-year-old son have been stuck in security screening since August 2023.

**What Does Prolonged Security Screening Feel Like?**

It feels like an emotional cycle that never ends:

Anxious → trying to distract ourselves → trying to "live like locals" and forget about the application → anxious again.

We try to carry on with daily life. We tell ourselves to think like Canadians, to settle in, to stop checking updates. But every time we hear that someone who entered security screening much later than us has already passed, the anxiety returns — mixed with confusion and frustration.

Isn't there supposed to be a line? First in, first out?

**The Real Impact on Our Lives**

Because of the ongoing security screening:

- My husband and I could not follow our original plans to study with domestic tuition fees.
- Some job opportunities require PR or citizenship, so we were not even eligible to apply.
- We can only rent, and frequent moves have become unavoidable.
- Our son has already changed three elementary schools. Each time we move, he gives us that innocent look — the look of a child who doesn't want to lose his friends again. He loves Canada. From the very first day he arrived, he loved going to school. He loves his teachers and classmates, who are kind and welcoming.

Sometimes he asks me, "Mom, I really wish we had PR. When will we get it?"

I don't know how to answer him.

**The Practical Difficulties**

Because of the prolonged security screening, we already renewed our Bridging Open Work Permit in April 2025, and the renewal took nearly 6 months.

Each work permit renewal means:

- Updating our health card
- Updating our SIN
- Uploading documents to CRA
- Waiting up to six months for the new permit

During the renewal period, although we have maintained status and can legally continue working, we cannot leave Canada. Even worse, our child benefits are paused during that time, putting additional financial pressure on our already tight budget.

All of these inconveniences — we can accept.

What we cannot accept is the uncertainty.

**Life on Pause**

We do not know when the security screening will end. There is no timeline. No deadline. No visible finish line.

Our life feels like it has been paused. Our original plans were disrupted. We cannot make new plans.

How many three-year periods does a person have in life?

We understand that security screening is an important and necessary part of the immigration process. We respect that. What we hope for is simple: a clear deadline.

A date that allows us to look forward. A timeline that allows us to plan our future.

**Still Holding Hope**

Our Canadian friends often ask us, "Did you get your PR yet?" When we say we are still waiting after almost three years, they are genuinely surprised. They cannot understand why it takes so long.

Like many immigrants, we chose Canada wholeheartedly. We came with hope and without a backup plan elsewhere. We did not expect the waiting process itself to last this long.

And yet, we still have faith in the Canadian immigration system. We sincerely hope that IRCC can provide a clear deadline for security screening. We hope to regain the ability to plan our lives. We desire — and we deserve — certainty about our future.
