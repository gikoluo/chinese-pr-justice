Hello!

I'd like to share my story of being security checked for both my PR application and TRV application.

I submitted my PR application on January 17, 2024, and it was placed into security screening in March 2024. Since then, my life has been in a constant state of uncertainty.

My first work permit was a closed work permit, which meant I could only work for my designated employer. From July 2024 to July 2025, I endured an entire year under a toxic manager. Because I was legally unable to change jobs, I felt trapped. That year was the darkest period of my life. For the first time, I experienced severe depression and even had thoughts of ending my life. I felt completely powerless—tied to a job that was destroying my mental health, while my immigration status remained in limbo.

During that time, I desperately reached out to IRCC, pleading for help and asking for my PR application to be processed. I received no response. I felt invisible.

In October, while my Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP) had already been in process for nine months, I was laid off. Because my PR application was linked to my employer, I was suddenly facing the reality that I might have to return to China and abandon everything I had worked so hard to build in Canada—my career, my stability, my life.

Fortunately, I managed to secure another position within the same company, and after nearly ten months, my BOWP was finally approved. It felt like a small light at the end of a very long tunnel. I immediately applied to extend my TRV.

Although I still live with the constant fear that losing my job could mean losing my right to remain in Canada, I tried to stay hopeful and believe that things would gradually improve.

However, my TRV application was placed into security screening once again. As a direct result, I had to cancel my flight back to China. I have not seen my family for two years. Now, I am facing the possibility of not being able to see my parents for several more years. The emotional toll of this prolonged uncertainty is overwhelming.

Over the past two years, I have endured continuous stress, instability, and psychological suffering due to repeated delays and security screenings without explanation. I fully respect Canada's security procedures, but I sincerely hope to receive a reasonable explanation and fair consideration for the extraordinary hardship this process has caused.

I am not asking for special treatment—only for transparency, compassion, and a timely resolution.
