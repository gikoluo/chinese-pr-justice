PETITION TO THE: Government of Canada

===== WHEREAS BOXES (7 total - click "Add" to get more boxes) =====

BOX 1:
Thousands of Permanent Residence (PR) applicants are experiencing extreme delays in security screening, with many cases exceeding 30-40 months — far beyond published service standards;

BOX 2:
As of November 30, 2025, according to official IRCC statistics, Canada's immigration system holds 2,130,700 total applications, with 1,005,800 (47%) in backlog exceeding service standards — more than double IRCC's stated 20% target;

BOX 3:
For Permanent Residence applications specifically, the majority are delayed: of 941,600 total PR applications, only 426,600 (45%) are within service standards while 515,000 (55%) are in backlog;

BOX 4:
THE CRISIS IS WORSENING: IRCC's own data shows Provincial Nominee Program backlogs reached 20% target by mid-2023, yet by November 2025 climbed to 53%, with projections of 56% by January 2026 — a complete system collapse in 18 months;

BOX 5:
These extreme delays cause severe harm including: prolonged family separation, mental health crises, loss of legal status and work authorization, denial of healthcare access, lost career opportunities, and catastrophic financial burdens of $130,000-$200,000;

BOX 6:
Current processing times violate applicants' rights and create a discriminatory two-tier system where certain applicants from specific countries face indefinite delays, as documented by NSIRA investigations and Auditor General reports;

BOX 7:
Applicants have no access to transparent information about their cases, no meaningful recourse when service standards are violated by 300-500%, and no compensation for documented harm;

===== WE, THE UNDERSIGNED =====
residents of Canada,

===== CALL UPON THE =====
Government of Canada and the House of Commons in Parliament assembled

===== TO =====

implement a comprehensive three-pillar solution:

PILLAR 1: IMMEDIATE CRISIS RESOLUTION

1. Immediately Address the Backlog Crisis: Allocate emergency resources to clear the 515,000 PR applications in backlog within 12 months, bringing backlog levels back to the 20% target last achieved in 2023;

2. Immediately Expedite Low-Risk Cases That Have Completed CSIS Screening: For applicants who have successfully completed CSIS security screening and whose CBSA screening has exceeded service standards, expedite final processing to completion within 30 days;

PILLAR 2: SYSTEMIC JUSTICE & TRANSPARENCY

3. Ensure Equal Treatment Regardless of Country of Origin: Immediately end discriminatory processing practices by conducting an independent audit of processing times by country, implementing corrective measures within 90 days, and publishing quarterly reports to Parliament;

4. Provide Transparency and Communication: Require IRCC, CSIS, and CBSA to provide proactive case updates every 90 days, including which agency is processing the file, what stage the case is at, and estimated timelines;

5. Create Independent Oversight: Establish an independent immigration ombudsperson with authority to investigate IRCC delays; and create an independent oversight body for CBSA immigration security screening (equivalent to NSIRA's oversight of CSIS);

6. Implement Interim Relief Measures: For applicants waiting beyond 200% of service standards, immediately grant: (a) open work permits valid until final decision, (b) ability to sponsor immediate family members, and (c) temporary status documents;

PILLAR 3: ENFORCEMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY

7. Establish Parliamentary Oversight with Consequences: Require the Minister to appear before the Standing Committee quarterly to answer specific questions on backlogs, discrimination, and resource allocation; and mandate that if backlog levels exceed 30% or processing disparities by country are not reduced by 50% within 12 months, the Minister must table an emergency action plan with dedicated funding to Parliament for approval;

8. Establish Mandatory Service Standards with Consequences: Implement enforceable service standards with automatic escalation and ministerial review for any case exceeding service standards by more than 100%.
