🇨🇦 JOIN THE E-PETITION TEAM - VOLUNTEERS NEEDED! 🇨🇦
================================================================================

PROJECT: House of Commons E-Petition on PR Processing Delays
GOAL: Force government action on 42+ month delays affecting thousands of families
EVENT: March 13, 2026 - Parliament Hill Procession
WEBSITE: chinese-pr-delay.ca

================================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
================================================================================

Over 515,000 PR applications are stuck in backlog (55% of all applications).
Families wait 30-40+ months beyond service standards, causing:
• Family separation (years apart from spouses, children)
• Financial crisis ($130K-$200K excess costs per family)
• Mental health impacts (no updates, no end date)
• Lost careers and opportunities

Government data proves the system is collapsing: backlogs went from 20% (2023)
to 55% (2025). We're demanding immediate action through an official e-petition.
