Thank you for documenting the impact of prolonged security screening delays. We would like to share our experience.

## 1. Timeline

We submitted our permanent residence application in August 2022.
Security screening began in June 2023 and has now been ongoing for over two and a half years, with no updates or clear indication of progress.

As of today, our PR application has been pending for nearly four years.

## 2. Emotional Hardship – Loss and Helplessness

In 2024, my husband's father passed away.

At that time, my husband was still under security screening and awaiting renewal of his work permit. Because our permanent residence application had not yet been approved, and his legal status in Canada depended on maintaining continuous work authorization, he could not leave the country without risking his ability to return and continue supporting our family.

As a result, he was unable to travel home to say goodbye to his father in person.

He said his final farewell over the phone while trying to comfort his elderly mother. It was one of the most painful moments for him — and for our entire family.

I tried to console him by saying, "Once the PR is approved, we'll go home together to visit your father's grave."

But another year has passed, and nothing has changed.

The prolonged uncertainty has left us with a deep sense of loss and helplessness. It continues to affect his emotional well-being and our family's overall stability.

## 3. Impact on Our Children – Loss of Stability and Belonging

Our 11-year-old daughter has long hoped that we would one day have a stable home of our own.

Each Halloween, she asks if we can decorate "our own house" and invite friends over for trick-or-treating. But because we still live in a shared rental unit, we have to tell her, "maybe next year."

Over time, she has become quieter and more withdrawn. As parents, it is heartbreaking to see how prolonged uncertainty has affected her sense of stability and belonging.

## 4. Financial and Settlement Impact

Because our PR application remains pending, we have been unable to make key settlement decisions, such as selling our home overseas.

We continue to pay both a mortgage abroad and rent in Canada, creating significant financial strain. The uncertainty makes it extremely difficult for us to plan our future or fully settle in Canada, despite having already built our lives here.

## 5. What We Want the Government to Know

We fully respect the importance of security screening.

However, security screening should not become an indefinite and opaque process. Law-abiding families deserve reasonable timelines, transparency, and communication about the status of their cases.

Prolonged silence creates profound emotional, financial, and social consequences that extend far beyond administrative delay.

We hope the government will:

- Establish clearer timelines for security screening
- Improve transparency and communication
- Ensure that applications are processed within a reasonable and accountable timeframe
