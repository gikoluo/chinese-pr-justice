## My Story and Timeline

I came to Canada alone in 2009 as a young student, carrying hope and determination. Over the past 16 years, I worked hard to build my education and career, and I later immigrated through the economic class in 2015. I built a life in Canada, the country I poured my heart and soul into because I deeply believe in its promise of equity, inclusiveness, and compassion.

After being eligible to sponsor my parents to come to Canada for over 7 years, I was finally selected in the annual lottery draw to apply for them in October 2022. As of February 2026, it has been over 40 months since I applied. Their file remains in "comprehensive security screening", with no explanation, no meaningful updates, and no timeline.

My parents have been retired for years. They have no criminal history or background that would reasonably raise any national security concern. Yet year after year, they remain stuck in this invisible process that no one can explain. They have previously been to Canada, gone through the immigration processes multiple times and were cleared through security screening as recently as 2020. There were no concerns all these years, which makes the current indefinite screening even more difficult to understand.

I spent most of my professional life working in the public sector in the GTA, focusing on development and housing, one of Canada's most urgent national priorities. Every day, I work to help Canadian families build homes and find stability. Yet while I contribute to strengthening communities here, no one seems to be taking care of my own family.

My partner, who is the co-sponsor for my parents, is also a working professional contributing to Canada's economy. Together, we are long-term taxpayers and active members of our community. We pay substantial income and property taxes, make charitable donations, and contribute in every way expected of responsible citizens. We built our future in Canada with the expectation of stability and fairness.

## Impact on Our Family

The human cost of this delay is not abstract:

- It is watching my parents get older through a screen, missing milestones in their lives.
- It is the worry that if they were sick or something unexpected happened, I may not be there when they need me the most.
- It is planning our lives in short increments, a few months at a time, because we cannot rely on the system to operate within its own stated standards.
- It is never being able to answer a simple question: when will we finally be together again?

The prolonged uncertainty has taken a significant toll on my mental health. Over the years, I have lived with depression and anxiety as a result of this situation. It affects my personal life daily, and my overall well-being. Carrying this emotional burden while continuing to serve my community has been incredibly difficult.

Through this experience, I've connected with a network of hundreds of other retired parents who are also placed in prolonged security screening, whether for permanent residence or a basic visitor visa. Many have waited for years without answers, and some tragically passed away during the wait. They simply want to spend their later years with their children and grandchildren. They should not have to suffer because of a failed system that lacks accountability.

## What I Want the Government to Know

We respect the importance of national security. However, security should not mean indefinite silence. When screening extends years beyond official service standards, and families are given no transparency or recourse, it stops feeling like due diligence and begins to feel like a strategy.

Family reunification should never come at the cost of dignity or basic humanity. I chose Canada in 2009 because I believed in its values. I still want to believe in those today. I hope the government will recognize the human cost of these delays, provide reasonable timelines and transparency, so families like mine can finally live with certainty and be together.
