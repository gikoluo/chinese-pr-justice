My name is Mengzhuo Liu, and I am writing to share my experience as an inland spousal sponsorship applicant currently facing prolonged security screening.

**My Timeline**

I submitted my inland spousal sponsorship application on December 4, 2024.

As of now, I have been waiting for over one year. On January 29, 2026, my application entered security screening. The normal estimated processing time was approximately one year, but my case has now exceeded that timeline and remains in extended background checks.

**Impact on My Family/Career/Finance**

I hold a dental degree from China. After getting married and moving to Canada, I planned to continue my education and pursue professional licensing so that I could build a stable career and contribute to our household income.

However, the prolonged security screening has significantly delayed my academic and career plans. Many educational pathways and licensing programs require permanent residency status for long-term planning. The uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to commit to multi-year programs or make financial decisions.

In addition, I am unable to travel freely to visit my family in China. Being separated from parents and loved ones for an extended and uncertain period has caused emotional stress for both me and my family.

This prolonged delay affects not only my career progression, but also our family stability, financial planning, and mental well-being.

**What I Want Government to Know**

I fully respect Canada's need for security screening. However, prolonged and indefinite delays without transparency create deep uncertainty for families like mine.

We hope for:

- Greater transparency about the stages of security screening
- Reasonable timelines and clearer communication
- Fair and timely processing for applicants who have already waited beyond normal processing times

Why do most Chinese applicants get security screening while Indian applicants and refugees pass?

We came to Canada with the intention of building our lives here, contributing professionally, and integrating into society. We are not asking for special treatment—only for fairness, clarity, and timely decisions.
