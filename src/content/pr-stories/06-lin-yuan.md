I submitted the PR application for my parents in November 2022 and was given the Pre-Arrival Letter in August 2023. The endless security check started in the same month even though both my parents were retired and had no sensitive background.

I live in Canada alone without any family support, and I have to deal with moderate depression, anxiety and PTSD due to an incident that happened in 2025. Having my family united in Canada became an unrealistic dream after over 40 months of waiting.

It is so frustrating with the endless waiting and lack of communication from IRCC. It is not reasonable to conduct security check for such a long period of time.
