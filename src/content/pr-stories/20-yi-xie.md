I will reach 35 months of waiting by March for my inland PR application — a process that should take less than 6 months. My inland TRV has been stuck for 30 months as well.

I have been unable to leave Canada for almost three years because both my PR and TRV were placed into "security screening," with no updates and no timeline. CSIS has already confirmed they completed their part early in 2025, yet IRCC still refuses to finalize anything or even explain why the delay continues.

**This endless wait has destroyed my life.**

I have not been able to see my parents, who have been seriously ill, for three years. My marriage has faced severe strain because we have been living under constant uncertainty. My mental health has collapsed; every day feels like being trapped without control over my own life.

I am a software engineer who has worked full-time in Canada since 2021. In five years, I was unemployed for only two months. I have followed every rule, paid taxes, worked full-time, maintained legal status, and contributed to Canada. But the system has trapped me in a cycle of silence and indefinite delay, with no accountability and no path forward.

I'm sharing my story because no one should suffer like this. I hope it helps raise awareness of how badly the security-screening backlog is hurting real people and real families.
