I am a permanent residence applicant under Express Entry (FSW).

After completing my doctoral studies in Europe, I chose Canada because I believe in bilingual education, innovation, and openness. I planned to build a language-focused technology project aligned with Canada's bilingual environment and long-term workforce needs. Canada represented opportunity, contribution, and stability.

I submitted my permanent residence application in April 2024. A few months later, my file entered background verification. Since then, there has been no meaningful progress and no clear timeline. I have now been waiting for nearly two years in extended screening.

This prolonged uncertainty has had serious consequences.

My professional plans have effectively been frozen. Potential collaborations in Canada cannot move forward because I cannot provide clarity regarding my long-term legal status. Strategic decisions that define a growing venture — investment, long-term partnerships, operational planning — all require stability. Without immigration certainty, everything remains suspended.

Time-sensitive opportunities do not wait. When momentum is interrupted for this long, it cannot simply be restored later. Even if a decision is eventually made, the years already lost to uncertainty cannot be recovered.

Financially, the delay has created increasing pressure. Long-term planning becomes impossible under indefinite screening. Major commitments must remain on hold. This creates structural instability, not merely inconvenience.

The psychological impact has also been significant. Living in an open-ended administrative process without transparency or foreseeable completion has intensified anxiety and depression. It is difficult to sustain hope when there is no visible movement and no communication about what remains outstanding.

I respect the importance of background and security screening. National security matters. However, screening should be completed within a reasonable and transparent timeframe. There should be accountability and clear communication about what stage a file is at and what remains to be done.

I am not asking to bypass security checks. I am asking for transparency, accountability, and reasonable timelines.
