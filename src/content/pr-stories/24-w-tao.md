Hello everyone,

I stand here today not as a number, and not just as an immigration file ID.

I am a father, a husband, and an ordinary person who works in a kitchen every single day. Three years ago (Jan 22, 2023), my family and I applied for Canadian permanent residency. We believed that as long as we worked hard, followed the law, paid our taxes, and lived honestly, we could build a future here.

But three years have passed.

Our application has been placed under "Security Screening." No explanation. No timeline. No end in sight.

Many who applied much later than us have already received their results. Yet we remain stuck in place.

I am a chef. My job means I am not home on weekends, not home on holidays, and not home on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve. When other families are gathered around the dinner table, I am in the kitchen. When the fireworks go off on New Year's, I am at the stove.

My child once asked me: "Daddy, can you stay home for Christmas this year?" I didn't know how to answer. It's not because I didn't want to. It's because I cannot change my job. I cannot switch careers. I cannot go back to school to upgrade my skills. I am tied to this single position by my status—unable to move up, unable to grow.

In 2024, due to a delay in processing my work permit, I was unemployed for nearly half a year. For six months, I had zero income. Every morning, the first thing I did was calculate exactly how much longer our bank account could last.

My wife is trapped in the same waiting game. Twenty years ago, she was just an ordinary student majoring in English. After graduation, she worked as an administrative clerk—answering phones, booking flights, and organizing meeting rooms. But years later, these completely ordinary experiences have become the reason she is being subjected to an indefinite security screening.

She has a dream. She wants to be a baker. She loves baking and hopes to one day open a small shop of her own. But for three years, she hasn't been able to study or plan for the future. She can only wait.

Wait. And keep waiting.

Since my father passed away in 2018, I haven't been back to China. My mother is getting older, and I don't know how many years she has left. But I cannot leave Canada, because my status is suspended in a state with no answers.

The hardest part is not a rejection. The hardest part is a wait that has no end.

We are not criminals. We are not a threat. We are just an ordinary family.

We work. We pay our taxes. We follow the law. We send our child to school. We believe in Canadian fairness and justice.

We aren't here today to point fingers. We are simply asking that an application should not hang in the air indefinitely. A family should not be frozen for three years by administrative silence.

We are not asking for a privilege. We are asking for:

A decision.

A timeline.

A future.

Thank you.
