Three years ago, I was approved under Saskatchewan's provincial nominee program after meeting all required criteria. Based on that nomination, I submitted my federal permanent residence application in mid-2023. I passed eligibility, medical examinations, and criminality checks. I lawfully obtained a work permit, moved to Canada, secured employment, paid taxes, and began building a life in my community. At every stage, I complied fully with the rules.

In April 2024, my family's files entered security screening. Since then, there has been no decision and no explanation. What began as a structured, rules-based pathway has become an indefinite administrative pause. A process that once progressed predictably has stalled without timeline, clarity, or meaningful communication.

This delay has reduced our entire life to a temporary condition. Without permanent status, every major decision must be short-term. Housing is provisional. Career advancement is constrained. Long-term commitments cannot be made. Financial planning must assume uncertainty. My employer-specific work permit limits mobility and stability. Over the past three years, I have declined stronger employment opportunities—not because of performance or qualifications, but because administrative restrictions leave no flexibility. The cost of delay is cumulative, concrete, and irreversible.

The financial strain is intensified by structural constraints. My spouse must stay home to care for our daughter and has no income. As a work-permit holder tied to a single employer, I am not legally permitted to take on additional employment to ease the burden. A single-income household carries inherent vulnerability, and prolonged uncertainty compounds that vulnerability.

During this period, our daughter was born in Canada. She is a Canadian citizen by birth. Yet from her first day of life, she has grown up in an environment shaped by unresolved immigration status. For a significant period, despite our full compliance with the law, paying taxes, and contributing to Saskatchewan's economy, she was unable to access the Canada Child Benefit. The contradiction is difficult to ignore: a citizen child's statutory entitlement became entangled in prolonged administrative uncertainty affecting her parents. A temporary permit was meant to be transitional; it was never intended to define a child's formative years.

The psychological toll is equally profound. Living year after year without clarity produces sustained stress. Administrative silence does not remain confined to paperwork; it permeates daily life. Over time, prolonged uncertainty erodes stability and becomes a genuine health risk.

As a Saskatchewan resident, I am encouraged to see trade relations between China and Saskatchewan improve, with governments emphasizing cooperation and people-to-people ties. These are positive signals of mutual trust and long-term engagement. Yet prolonged and indefinite security screening in individual cases sends a conflicting signal. Economic partnership depends not only on agreements between governments, but on trust at the level of individuals.

I do not question the importance of national security. But when a process continues for years without transparency, proportional limits, or communication, delay itself becomes a substantive burden. I am not asking for preferential treatment. I am asking for a fair decision within a reasonable timeframe. A rules-based system should not allow administrative silence to become the outcome.
