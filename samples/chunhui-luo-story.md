## Teaser (for story card)

I applied for Permanent Residence through BC PNP in August 2022 — over 3.5 years ago. Everything passed: eligibility, criminality, medical. Only security screening remains. CSIS took 35 months. Now CBSA has had my file for 7+ months. My CBSA notes show a pattern of overdue events and missed deadlines. My son will apply to university in Fall 2027, and without PR, we face $130,000-200,000 in extra tuition costs.

## Full Story

### The Wait That Stole Three Years

I applied for Permanent Residence through BC PNP in August 2022. I came to Canada legally, worked hard, paid taxes, and contributed to this society. I followed every rule. I did everything right.

It has been **42 months**. Over **3.5 years** of my life in limbo.

### The Two-Step Nightmare

My security screening has been a two-step process that violated service standards at every turn:

**Step 1: CSIS (August 2022 – July 16, 2025)**
- Official service standard: 110 days
- Actual time: **35 months**
- Delay beyond standard: **32 months** (10 times longer than promised)

**Step 2: CBSA (July 2025 – present)**
- Official service standard: 110 days
- Actual time: **7+ months and counting**
- Delay beyond standard: **3+ months** (already triple the standard)

**Total delay: 35+ months beyond service standards.**

When I requested my CBSA notes through ATIP, I discovered a disturbing pattern: my file shows multiple "overdue events" and "due dates" that were simply ignored. The system isn't just slow — it's broken, and nobody is held accountable.

### The Financial Devastation

My son will apply for university admission in Fall 2027. The tuition status is determined by my PR status on the **application deadline date: March 15, 2027**.

**Without PR:**
- International student tuition: $40,000–50,000 per year
- Total for 4-year degree: $160,000–200,000

**With PR:**
- Domestic tuition: $6,000–8,000 per year
- Total for 4-year degree: $24,000–32,000

**Total cost difference: $130,000–200,000**

I hold a Bridging Open Work Permit (BOWP). I verified with all top 8 Canadian universities — UBC, SFU, University of Toronto, McGill, McMaster, Waterloo, Western, and Queen's. **None of them accept BOWP for domestic tuition rates.** UBC even repealed their work permit exemption in May 2025.

**PR is the only solution.**

But here's the cruel reality: even if IRCC grants my PR tomorrow, if they delay past March 15, 2027, I will lose $150,000+ regardless of when they finally make their decision. **The government's delay is not just administrative inconvenience — it is financial devastation.**

### The Mental and Emotional Toll

For 42 months, I have lived in a state of suspended animation:

- **I cannot plan my future.** Will I be approved? Rejected? When?
- **I cannot invest in my career.** Should I buy a house? Start a business? What if I'm denied after all this wait?
- **I cannot give my family security.** My son asks, "Will we have to leave Canada?" I have no answer.

Every day, I check my application status. Every day, it says the same thing: "**In Progress**." For 42 months.

This is psychological torture.

### Evidence of Systemic Discrimination

I recently obtained the government's own 2023 CBSA evaluation report. It reveals a disturbing truth:

- **Chinese PR applicants face disproportionately high referral rates** for security screening
- **Applicants from certain countries receive significantly more inconclusive recommendations**
- The evaluation explicitly identified "**potential for program effectiveness improvement**" in country-specific screening

The 2024-2025 statistics make it worse:
- **CSIS security screening requests doubled to 538,100** (from ~300,000 historically)
- **Total immigration backlog reached 842,800 cases** (June 2025)
- **PR applications are the "hardest hit" — nearly 50% are backlogs**
- **Complaints against CSIS increased by 200%** in 2024

The government promised a **$40 million Security Screening Automation (SSA)** initiative to be completed by FY 2023-2024. I applied **after** that promised completion date. **Where is the improvement?**

The system has gotten **worse**, not better.

### What I Want the Government to Know

**I am being punished for my country of birth.** This is not security screening — this is racial profiling dressed up in bureaucratic language.

I have done everything right:
- ✓ Applied through legal channels (BC PNP)
- ✓ Passed all eligibility requirements
- ✓ Passed criminality checks
- ✓ Passed medical examinations
- ✓ Paid all fees
- ✓ Provided all requested documents
- ✓ Waited patiently for 42 months

**What more do you want from me?**

My son is watching. He sees how Canada treats people who follow the rules. He sees how the government makes promises it doesn't keep. He sees how bureaucratic delays can destroy a family's future.

**Is this the Canada you want him to see?**

### My Demands

I am not asking for special treatment. I am demanding what the law already guarantees:

1. **Make a decision on my application within 30 days** — I have waited 35 months beyond service standards
2. **Grant interim PR benefits** to all applicants waiting beyond 24 months (tuition, healthcare, mobility)
3. **Launch an Auditor General investigation** into CBSA/CSIS discrimination patterns
4. **Compensate families** who suffer financial harm due to unreasonable delays
5. **Enforce service standards** with weekly public reporting for overdue cases
6. **Hold CBSA and CSIS accountable** when standards are violated

### My Message to Other Affected Families

You are not alone. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of us suffering in silence.

**We refuse to wait in silence anymore.**

Join us. Share your story. Demand accountability.

Together, we will force this government to keep its promise: that if you work hard, follow the rules, and contribute to society, you will be treated fairly.

**Canada has broken that promise. Today, we demand that they keep it.**

*"We followed every rule. We did everything right. Yet we're treated like we don't deserve basic fairness. My son's future is being destroyed by bureaucratic delays and systemic discrimination. How many more families must suffer before this government takes action?"*
